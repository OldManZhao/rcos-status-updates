## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I worked on learning about the UI components of Swift and attempting to connect code to UI. I also worked on a rough draft for our UI design.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to continue learning about how to connect the UI components of Swift to actual code so that the UI can be working and responsive and be able to push a rough UI onto github.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

We are still designing our UI and the project leader has not given us any leads on specifically how he wants the UI to be so everything is based on what my teammates think would be best.
